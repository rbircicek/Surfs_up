# Surfs_up Challenge

# Overview

The purpose of this project is to find out if the Surf&Icecream Shop business is feasible whole year. The months focused are June and December, the sixth and twelfth months. This focus is reasonable since they are in the middle and the end of the calendar and belong to the opposite seasons, summer and winter. The results show that due to the geographic loacation of Oahu, the weather conditions are quite similar in these months which makes the business look sustainable. 

# Analysis 

#June

The June data for eight years contain 1700 observations with mean of 74.9 F, standard deviation of 3.26 F. The minimum temperature is 64 F, lower quartile is 73 F, median is 75, upper quartile is 77 F,  and the maximum temperature is 85 F. Notice that median is very close to the mean. This shows that data is uniformaly distributed and the range is 21 F.

#December

The December data for eight years contain 1517 observations with mean of 71.04 F, standard deviation of 3.75 F. The minimum temperature is 56 F, lower quartile is 69 F, median is 71 F, upper quartile is 74 F,  and the maximum temperature is 83 F. Notice that median is very close to the mean. This shows that data is uniformaly distributed too in December and the range is 27 F.

#Summary

The standard deviation for December data is bigger than the standard deviation for June data. It means that the data for December is more spread and we can notice that  wider spread with the bigger range in December ( 27 F vs 21 F). The higher temperatures in June makes this month more attractive for the Surf&Icecream business. However, I would like to do more research on humidity and wind data in these months, since humidity will affect the tourist attraction and wind will affect the surf activities. If the waves in the ocean data is available too, this will also help us do a more acurate analysis for the sustainability of the business.
