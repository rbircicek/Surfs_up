# Surfs_up Challenge

#Overview

The purpose of this project is to find out if the Surf&Icecream Shop business is feasible whole year. The months focused are June and December, the sixth and twelfth months. This focus is reasonable since they are in the middle and the end of the calendar and belong to the opposite seasons, summer and winter. The results show that due to the geographic loacation of Oahu, the weather conditions are quite similar in these months which makes the business look sustainable. 

#Analysis 

#June

The June data for eight years contain 1700 observations with mean of 74.9, standard deviation of 3.26. The minimum temperature is 64 F, lower quartile is 73 F, median is 75, upper quartile is 77 F,  and the maximum temperature is 85 F. Notice that median is very close to the mean. This shows that data is uniformaly distributed and the range is 21 F.
